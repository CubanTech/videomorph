TODO List:
----------

Next version (1.1):
    - Pack in .rpm format
    - Pack for Arch Linux

Version (1.2)
    - Create a public interface in media.MediaList to handel the running file
      using delegation (running_file_name(), running_file_status(), running_file_info(),
      running_file_path())
    - Implement the main window interface in a separated module, maybe mainwindow.py
    - Move the business logic present in videomorph.py, about.py and other views to converter
      package
    - Move the HTML text hardcoded in about.py to a file distributed as doc. Read the about
      info from that file as done with the license

BugFix:
    -

Someday:
    - Allow drag and drop video files into the List of Conversion Tasks
    - Play the videos with the system default video player (in KDE branch)
    - Implement an alternative class for _Converter (subprocess maybe) to decouple from PyQt5
    - Implement model/view/controller pattern
    - Make it run on Windows
