TODO List:
----------

Next version (1.2):

    - Pack in .rpm format
    - Pack for Arch Linux
    - Pack as standard binary package, not as a Python package
    - Implement the main window interface in a separated module, maybe mainwindow.py
    - Move the business logic present in videomorph.py, about.py and other views to converter
      package
    - Move the HTML text hardcoded in about.py to a file distributed as doc. Read the about
      info from that file as done with the license
    - Create the blog in Cubava.cu with the domain videomorph.cubava.cu
    - Redesign app logo and the icons
    - Create an user manual
    - Allow drag and drop video files into the List of Conversion Tasks
    - Implement an alternative class for _Converter (subprocess maybe) to decouple from PyQt5

BugFix:
    -

Someday:
    - Pack in Flatpak or Snap
    - Implement model/view/controller pattern
    - Make it run on Windows
