TODO List:
----------

Next version or later:
    - Improve the Artwork, mainly the icons theme
    - Improve the performance of videomorph._fill_media_list method
    - Pack in .rpm format
    - Create a CONTROLLER to handle communication among VideoMorphMW and the models. Some methods to move:
        * check_conversion_lib
        * _fill_media_list

BugFix:
    - When user stops all the conversion tasks, the message is: 'Encoding Process Successfully Finished!'
      and must be: 'Encoding Process Stopped' or something
    - Removing a single file don't ask user confirmation

Someday:
    - Gnome integration
    - Make it run on Windows
