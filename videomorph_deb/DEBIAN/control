Description: Small Video Converter based on ffmpeg, Python 3 and Qt5.
 Unlike other video converters, VideoMorph focuses on a single goal:
 make video conversion simple, with an easy to use GUI and allowing
 the user to convert to the currently most popular video formats.
 .
 VideoMorph GUI is simple and clean, focused on usability, eliminating
 annoying options rarely used.
 VideoMorph is a video converter, just that. If you want a video editor,
 VideoMorph isn't for you.
