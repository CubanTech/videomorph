TODO List:
----------

Next version or later:
    - Improve the Artwork, mainly the icons theme
    - Pack in .rpm format
    - Disable the Play Output File context menu if the file doesn't exist,
      and in MP4 formats cause file can't be play until conversion is finished

BugFix:
    -

Someday:
    - Allow drag and drop video files into the List of Conversion Tasks
    - Play the videos with the system default video player
    - Implement model/view/controller pattern
    - Gnome integration
    - Make it run on Windows
